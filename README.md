## Calculator

A calculator I made for my school project. I guess it works.
Currently, can calculate with complex numbers.  
  
If you _really_ want to use this, u need to do a couple of steps.  
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have IntelliJ, and JDK version `16.0.2`.
3. Run `src/Main.main` method.  
  
If you follow these, you will probably get this to work.  
Happy coding!
